# Coding With Kids
I am a web developer, graphic designer, and avid problem solver. However, I am also a father. It's difficult to take time away from my family to advance my skills. So I decided, why not create things for them.

I will be pushing fun games and web apps that I have created for my kids to play with. I will also be [blogging about my projects](https://www.simeonsmith.me/coding-with-kids "Coding With Kids Blog - SimeonSmith.me") and my kids playing with them.

Please [check out my other work](https://www.simeonsmth.me/my-work "My Work - SimeonSmith.me") and feel free to [contact me](https://www.simeonsmith.me/contact-me "Contact Me - SimeonSmith.me") with any questions.
